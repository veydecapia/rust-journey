# 🦀 My Rust Smart Contract Developer Journey

Welcome to my public learning journal! This repository documents my personal journey to becoming a **Rust Smart Contract Developer** from scratch. I'm sharing everything I learn—from Rust fundamentals to smart contract development using platforms like **Substrate**, **Solana**, and **NEAR**.

## 🚀 Goal

To become a fully capable Rust smart contract developer within **6 months** by:
- Mastering core Rust concepts
- Building real-world projects
- Learning blockchain platforms that use Rust
- Documenting everything I learn along the way
